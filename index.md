`ch` is a command-line interface for using Docker containers as development environment. The tool provides a simple
Docker interface to manage multiple containerized development environments. Like the `docker exec -it`, the CLI has a
shell environment. This was designed to generalize how we develop C++ code in CSCI 104 to be portable enough to use
whichever Docker container you choose. Of course, this project would not be possible without the reference
of [docker/cli](https://github.com/docker/cli) which is how I learned how to use the Docker Engine API.

## What is this?

What's the use case for this tool? Good question! This tool is designed to make it easier to use a specific, isolated development environment. For classes
such as [CSCI 104](https://bytes.usc.edu/cs104/) (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CSCI 350 (Operating Systems) at USC, the legacy way of writing code in the class was using a large VM image inside Virtual Box,
or if you're lucky, VMWare. A more efficient and arguably smoother workflow involves setting using a Docker container with the class's compilers and
development tools installed. `ch` offers a consistent interface to configure and access these environments. See below for the commands to create
environments for these classes.
